# Training Simulation Prototype

This project is a **prototype for a simulation and training platform** designed to model complex real-world scenarios such as **combat, police, or rescue operations**.

## Overview

The key idea is to provide an **educational tool** where multiple participants take on different roles within a scenario:

- **Players** receive limited information and can issue instructions to their units.  
- A **Game Master** oversees the scenario, interprets player actions, and determines outcomes, steering the training session in relevant directions.

## Purpose

This setup allows for:

- Practicing decision-making under uncertainty  
- Exploring coordination and communication challenges  
- Creating repeatable but adaptable training exercises  

## Status

The project is built as a **prototype** to test core mechanics and concepts, rather than as a finished application.
